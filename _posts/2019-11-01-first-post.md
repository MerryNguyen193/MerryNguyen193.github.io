# Blog Week 1
## Topic and rationale
 Topic: Recharts http://recharts.org/en-US
 - Recharts is a charting library built on React components. 
 - Project 2 is for data visualization, and our developer (Marcia) may build the web by React, I can help her on the charts by using Recharts.
 
- Proposal for prototype (what will you build? How does this demonstrate your topic?)
- List of deliverables and tasks to be completed, if known
