# Week 7
## Topic and rationale
 Topic: Invision https://www.invisionapp.com
 - Invision is the platform that creates the workflow for all designs
 - Basically it is a tool for designer to make a prototype for their wireframes and mockups; for example, app design, web pages...
 - Users can share in a group and easily get feedbacks for their prototype
 - It works well with Sketch; however, users can upload any jpg, pnf, pdf files to start a prototype
